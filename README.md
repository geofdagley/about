## Introduction

This is a personal guide to my management style, communication preferences, and expectations. It's designed to foster an understanding of how we can best work together, support each other's growth, and achieve our team goals. Through this document, I aim to build a transparent, collaborative, and respectful team environment, emphasizing continuous improvement and mutual success.

### Background

### My Role

As the VP of Engineering, my role bridges the strategic vision of our CEO and CTO with the operational excellence of our software development teams. I am responsible for translating high-level objectives into actionable engineering goals, ensuring our projects align with the company's direction and meet market demands. My interaction with the development teams is pivotal, focusing on empowering team leads, fostering a culture of innovation, and maintaining high standards of technical performance. By providing guidance, resources, and support, I aim to create an environment where collaboration thrives and challenges are met with creative solutions. My commitment is to be accessible, responsive, and actively involved in driving our engineering efforts forward, while also ensuring our teams have what they need to succeed and grow.

### My Management Philosophy

- **Leadership Style:** My approach to leadership is rooted in delegation and trust. I believe in empowering my team by assigning ownership where it makes sense, avoiding becoming a bottleneck to progress. With the understanding that my direct reports often have the most context to make informed decisions, my role is to guide these decisions within the broader company vision and philosophy. I value open dialogue and feedback, ensuring that we are aligned and moving forward together.

- **Team Dynamics:** I champion a team environment where expertise in specific domains (like front-end or back-end development) is balanced with a willingness to understand and engage with the broader scope of our projects. It's essential for us to cultivate empathy towards all colleagues and stakeholders, ensuring no 'us vs. them' mentality takes root. Our team is a sanctuary for learning from mistakes, sharing feedback, and supporting each other's growth, always striving to be better than yesterday and helping teammates do the same.

- **Decision Making:** In our team, every decision has an owner. We value collaborative decision-making, ensuring that the final call is made with clarity and accountability. Documenting our decisions—both successes and failures—is crucial for our collective learning and future reference. Celebrating our wins and learning from our missteps are both part of our path to continuous improvement.

- **Feedback and Growth:** Growth and development are central to our team's ethos, and feedback is the fuel for this journey. Regular one-on-one meetings are dedicated not to project status, but to discussing personal development, team dynamics, and individual needs. This partnership between each team member and myself is about identifying opportunities, setting goals, and working together towards achieving them.

- **Innovation and Failure:** Embracing failure as a step towards innovation is a cornerstone of our philosophy. Our team is a safe space for experimentation, where taking risks is encouraged and learning from our mistakes is a given. Constant self-examination and pushing boundaries are part of our DNA, as we seek to go beyond the status quo in pursuit of excellence.

- **Work-Life Balance:** Recognizing the importance of rest and personal time is vital. While dedication to our work is appreciated, it should never come at the expense of our well-being or family time. I am committed to ensuring that work demands do not overshadow life outside of work and encourage the team to maintain a healthy balance, especially during intense project phases.

- **Change Management:** Change is a constant, and our adaptability defines our success. We approach change with empathy and a readiness to adjust our plans and priorities. Documentation, reevaluation, and open communication about the impacts of change ensure that we navigate these transitions smoothly, respecting the need for balance and clear expectations.

This philosophy guides how I manage, support, and collaborate with our team. It's about creating a culture where trust, innovation, and balance thrive, and where every team member feels valued and empowered. I look forward to growing together, learning from each other, and achieving our collective goals.

## Communication Preferences

### Availability

- **Office Hours:** I host weekly office hours dedicated to discussing topics that require additional attention outside of our regular check-ins. This is an opportunity for deeper discussions on a variety of subjects.
- **1-on-1 Sessions:** I schedule weekly or biweekly check-ins with team members to focus on personal development, feedback, and any concerns or ideas you might have. These sessions are not for project status updates but are aimed at fostering growth and continuous improvement.

### Scheduling Meetings

- **Agenda Requirement:** To ensure our meetings are productive and focused, all meetings must have a clear agenda. Meetings should be scheduled in advance whenever possible. If a meeting lacks an agenda, I may ask for clarification or suggest a reschedule, and I encourage you to do the same.

### Response Time

- **Asynchronous Communication:** I value asynchronous communication, recognizing that immediate responses are not always possible. For public discussions, use team channels to share information widely and prevent knowledge silos. If you need a quicker response, tagging me in a public channel is the first step. For more immediate concerns, direct messages are the second option, and as a last resort, texting or calling my cell phone is appropriate, especially for urgent matters.

### Communication Tools

- **Preferred Channels:** Public channels are my first preference for communication, followed by direct messages, and lastly, email for less urgent or more formal communications. For complex discussions requiring detailed explanations, start with a summary (TLDR) and link to a more comprehensive document for collaboration and comments. Video calls are reserved for nuanced discussions, with the expectation that key points and decisions will be documented afterward.

### Urgent Communications

- **Cell Phone Access:** In urgent situations, my cell phone is the most direct line of communication. Start with a text message and escalate to a phone call if there's no response within 15 minutes.

### Project Updates

- **Sprint Updates and Demos:** Beyond regular project ceremonies, I expect individual sprint updates within two days of a sprint's conclusion. Regular demos from teams on a weekly or bi-weekly rotation are also crucial, providing visibility into ongoing work and fostering cross-team awareness.

### Feedback

- **1-on-1 and Team Check-ins:** Feedback is a two-way street in our team. During our weekly or bi-weekly 1-on-1 sessions, we will exchange feedback focused on personal and professional growth. Additionally, monthly team check-ins will serve as a platform to discuss what's working and what can be improved, ensuring that we're aligned and moving forward together.

## Working With Me

### Expectations

- **Performance:** Ownership and accountability are key. If you commit to a task, you're responsible for its completion, documenting any changes, challenges, or delays along the way. We value our responsibility to our work and to each other, offering support and empathy as needed.

- **Professional Conduct:** Respect is non-negotiable. We own our mistakes and strive for understanding, not blame. Every interaction should reinforce our commitment to collaboration over confrontation, recognizing that successful outcomes rely on working together, not against one another.

### Communication

- **Open Channels:** Keep communication as open and public as possible. This fosters a transparent environment where information is shared and accessible. For discussions that go beyond quick exchanges, follow up with collaborative documentation. Personal discussions should remain in individual conversations, but remember, even simple queries can benefit others in the future.

### Decision Making

- **Autonomy vs. Guidance:** Independence in your work is expected, but knowing when to seek help is equally important. Striking the right balance between autonomy and seeking assistance is crucial for both individual and team success.

- **Handling Disagreements:** Disagreements are part of a healthy collaborative process. Decisions are made together, with a designated owner for each decision. We support one another in implementing these decisions, moving forward without holding grudges. Our environment is safe and supportive, aimed at resolving disagreements constructively.

### Support

- **Professional Development:** Your career growth is a shared journey. Whether you're an individual contributor aiming to master your craft or aspiring to leadership, I'm here to support your path. Leadership isn’t limited to people management, and understanding your career aspirations is vital. Your development is a collaborative effort, requiring open dialogue to align your goals with our team's needs.

- **Well-being:** Recognizing the importance of life outside work, I commit to being understanding and supportive of your needs. Communication is key; you don't need to share details, but letting me know when you need support is essential. Our team is a safe space, and I'm dedicated to helping you balance work with personal well-being.

## Getting The Best Out Of Me

### What I Respond Well To

- **Storytelling in Communication:** When discussing problems or solutions, I appreciate being walked through the narrative of what we're solving, why it's important, and how we plan to address it. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your communication, ensuring clarity and engagement. For detailed discussions, begin with a TLDR summary to set the context before diving deeper.

- **Initiative and Collaborative Problem Solving:** I value a proactive and collaborative approach to problem-solving. Don't wait for solutions to be handed down; be an active participant in discovering and troubleshooting issues. It's okay not to have all the answers or a fully formed solution from the start. Your role is beyond coding; it's about being a thoughtful partner in solving problems and developing solutions.

### Pet Peeves

- **Acronyms:** Overuse of acronyms is one of my biggest pet peeves. Acronyms can create confusion and barriers to understanding. Ensure decisions and significant changes are thoroughly documented to maintain clarity on our direction and rationale. Strive for your code to reflect the language and processes of our non-technical partners, minimizing the cognitive load for everyone involved.

- **Cognitive Load in Code:** Strive for your code to reflect the language and processes of our non-technical partners, minimizing the cognitive load for everyone involved.

- **Lack of Documentation:** Failing to document decisions leads to challenges and confusion later on.  Ensure decisions and significant changes are thoroughly documented to maintain clarity on our direction and rationale. 

- **Inefficiencies and Status Quo:** Don't be bound by the "we've always done it this way" mentality. I encourage questioning and reevaluating our processes to find more efficient, effective ways of working. Innovation and continuous improvement should be at the heart of what we do.

- **Resistance to Change:** Change is a constant, and flexibility in the face of change is crucial. While I understand the disruptive nature of change, especially in engineering, I expect openness and empathy towards the reasons behind necessary changes. It's not about changing for the sake of change but evolving to meet new challenges and opportunities.

## Lighter Side of Me

I have been a rocket scientist, an ERP software engineer, a programming instructor, a web developer, and a game programmer.  I usually have some side project going on at home in the evenings and weekends that helps to keep me technically challenged.  I am always learning something.

I have six 6 kids (4 girls and 2 boys) so there is never a lack of excitement in my house.  We also have 3 French Bulldogs and occasionally have litters of puppies that might show up on Zoom calls.

I occassionally color my beard to support my kids' sports teams, celebrate major achievements, or "just because" :D 

## Continuous Improvement

Embracing a culture of continuous improvement is central to how we operate. I am committed to this journey, both for myself and for our team. I welcome and encourage feedback on this document, my management style, and our team processes. This README is not set in stone; it's a living document meant to evolve based on our experiences, insights, and the changing landscape of our work.

Your perspectives are invaluable in shaping our path forward. Please share your thoughts, suggestions, and concerns openly. Whether it's during our one-on-one sessions, team meetings, or through any communication channel you're comfortable with, know that your voice will be heard and appreciated. Together, we'll refine our approaches, strategies, and interactions to better meet our shared goals and individual needs.

## Conclusion

Our journey is one of collaboration, growth, and achievement. Through clear communication, mutual respect, and a shared commitment to excellence, we will navigate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
